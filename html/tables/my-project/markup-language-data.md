# Markup Language Data

## HTML

Feature, Description
Abbreviation, HyperText Markup Language
Usage, To create and design web pages and web applications
Purpose, To structure and present content on web pages
Rules, Loose structure and rules
Case Sensitive, No
Tags, Doesn’t support custom tags i.e. fixed set of tags
Validation Method, DTD or browser validation
Complexity, Low (Easy to use and learn)

We can also use HTML to link different documents and embed multimedia.

## LaTeX

Feature, Description
Abbreviation, Lamport TeX
Usage, Writing structured documents with mathematical equations
Purpose, Produce high-quality typesetting
Rules, Strict structure and rules
Case Sensitive, Yes
Tags/Commands, Does support custom tags i.e. users can define their tags/commands
Validation Method, Compilation process
Complexity, Moderate (Difficult to use and learn)

Apart from writing structured documents, LaTeX can also be used in research papers, publications and presentations.

## XML

Feature, Description
Abbreviation, eXtensible Markup Language
Usage, For data trading and data storage
Purpose, To encrypt documents in a human-readable and computer-readable format
Rules, Strict structure and rules
Case Sensitive, Yes
Tags, Does support custom tags i.e. users can define their tags
Validation Method, DTD or XML Schema validation
Complexity, Moderate (Difficult to use and learn)

Apart from data trading and data storage, XML can also be used to configure files.

## XHTML

Feature, Description
Abbreviation, eXtensible HyperText Markup Language
Usage, Formulation of HTML and XML to perform strict syntax rules for web development
Purpose, To create well-structured and cleaned files that are easy to process by the XML tools
Rules, Strict structure and rules
Case Sensitive, Yes
Tags, Doesn’t support custom tags
Validation Method, DTD or Schema validation
Complexity, Moderate (Challenging to use comparable to HTML)

XHTML can also be used to create web pages, and its syntax makes them consistent.

## KML

Purpose, Present and visualize location-based information on web apps such as Google Earth.
Rules, Strict structure and rules
Case Sensitive, Yes
Tags, Doesn’t support custom tags
Validation Method, DTD or Schema validation
Complexity, Moderate (Difficult to use and learn with advanced features)

KML can also map annotations, create time-based animations, and style custom maps.

## MathML

Feature, Description
Abbreviation, Mathematical Markup Language
Usage, Mathematical, scientific, and academic publishing
Purpose, Focuses on encoding complicated scientific and mathematical data so that it may be understandable by machines and humans, too
Rules, Strict structure and rules
Case Sensitive, Yes
Tags, Doesn’t support custom tags
Validation Method, DTD or Schema validation
Complexity, High (Difficult to use and learn)

This language also helps e-learning platforms by representing mathematical formulas on web pages.

## SGML

Feature, Description
Abbreviation, Standard Generalized Markup Language
Usage, Define document structures for varied applications
Purpose, It is XML’s forerunner and offers an architecture for building unique document formats.
Rules, Loose structure and rules
Case Sensitive, No
Tags, Does support custom tags i.e. users can define their tags
Validation Method, DTD or Schema validation
Complexity, High (Difficult to use and learn)

We can also create HTML and XML using SGML markup language. So, XML is a subset of SGML.

## Markdown

Feature, Description
Abbreviation, Markdown
Usage, Formatting plain text
Purpose, Makes text formatting easier for a variety of uses, with an emphasis on readability and effortless use
